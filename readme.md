# Password Wallet
Users can create accounts to securely store their passwords for various websites in one place. The password for the user account is encrypted using either SHA-512 or HMAC, depending on the user's choice during registration. Passwords for other websites are encrypted with AES. Users have the right to view, edit, and delete passwords from their accounts.
